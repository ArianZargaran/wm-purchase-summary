##Style-sheet
The Style Sheet of this project is built with plain CSS. Modularity in React allowes to avoid using compilers but also embraces them if it's needed.

1. In order to remove default browser values applied a reset stylesheet through reset.css per taking control of any odd behaviour on any browser and applying, at the same time a cross-browser style consistency.
2. After resetting the styles applied css native variables on :root to avoid redudancy of code.
